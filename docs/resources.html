    <p>Everyone will need <strong>Android Studio</strong> - https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html</p>

<p>If youâ€™d like to pick it up on your own, the <strong>Big Nerd Ranch</strong> have a really very good book to pick up Android (they have an iOS book too) - https://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/</p>

<p><strong>Amal</strong> has written a more advanced android tutorial located at https://github.com/K4KYA/MakersHelloAndroid/tree/codebar if you want to take Android even further :)</p>

<p><strong>Google</strong> also has their own tutorial series at https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html, which touches on some of the details and complexities of Android app development - saving data, sharing things with other apps, getting location data and other things you may want a more complex app to be able to do.</p>

<p><strong>Udacity</strong> also have a super course available which women can apply for a scholarship here https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships</p>
